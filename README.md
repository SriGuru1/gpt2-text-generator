# GPT-2 Based Text Generator

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune and use OpenAI's GPT-2 model for generating human-like text using the `transformers` library by Hugging Face.

## 🎯 Objective
Generate coherent and creative text using a pre-trained language model (GPT-2) based on a user-provided prompt.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Transformers (by Hugging Face)
- Pretrained GPT-2 Model

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The user enters a prompt (e.g., “The future of AI in India...”)
2. The model generates text based on the context
3. GPT-2 continues the sentence in a human-like way

## 📈 Applications
- Generative AI & NLP
- Chatbots & Text Assistants
- Creative Writing Automation

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers
2. Run the notebook:

gpt2_generator.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter

3. Sample Output:

Input Prompt: "The future of AI in India"
Generated Output: "The future of AI in India is bright. With growing investment and talent..."
📌 Notes
Model used: gpt2 (small)
